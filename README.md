# Official Bakery Shop

Welcome to the **Official Bakery Shop** project! This is a React-based web application where you can explore different bakery categories and items like cakes, pastries, and more. The project is a practice ground for learning key concepts of React, along with incorporating modern frontend tools and libraries.

## Features

- **Category Selection**: Choose from different categories like cakes, pastries, and more.
- **Item Cards**: View detailed bakery item cards, including images, descriptions, and prices.
- **Add to Cart**: Add items to your cart and see the cart update dynamically.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap for mobile and desktop responsiveness.
- **Modal Interactions**: Open modal windows to view more item details.
- **Sass Integration**: Styling is managed using Sass for easy customization.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: For building interactive UI components.
- **Bootstrap**: For styling and layout responsiveness.
- **FontAwesome**: For adding icons to the app.
- **Sass**: For enhanced styling with variables and mixins.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Using modern JavaScript features like the spread operator and destructuring.

## React Concepts Practiced

- **Component-based Architecture**: Breaking down the UI into reusable components.
- **State Management**: Using `useState` to manage categories and the cart system.
- **Props**: Passing data between components using props and spreading properties (`...props`).
- **Event Handling**: Handling click events, such as adding items to the cart.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displaying components based on user interaction.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
